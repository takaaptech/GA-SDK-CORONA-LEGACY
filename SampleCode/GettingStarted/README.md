Game Analytics for Corona SDK: Getting started example 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example shows how setup the GA SDK and submit some events.

In order to try this example you need to sign up for a Game Analytics account and paste the game 
key and secret key you recieve in the initialization fields in the main.lua file.

When running this example you should look at the Corona terminal to see what events are being 
sent. If you get 'Server response: {"status":"ok"}'' when submitting an event, then the servers have 
recieved the event and everything is setup correctly.
